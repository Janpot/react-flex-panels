# Three-Pane Layout

A classic layout with fixed sidebars and a flexible main content area. Perfect for dashboards, admin interfaces, or any application with sidebar navigation.

## Demo

<DemoSection demo={<ThreePaneDemo />} tsSource={threePaneSrc} cssSource={threePaneCss} />

## How it works

- The outer `Panel` with `group` prop creates a flex container
- The left panel has a fixed width of `200px` (fixed size)
- The middle panel has no initialSize prop, so it automatically fills available space
- The right panel has a fixed width of `150px` (fixed size)
