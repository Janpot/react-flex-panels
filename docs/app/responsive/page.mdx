# Responsive Layout

Create flexible layouts that automatically grow and shrink to fill available space. Panels without initialSize props share space equally.

## Demo

<DemoSection demo={<ResponsiveDemo />} tsSource={responsiveSrc} cssSource={responsiveCss} />

## How it works

- Both panels have no initialSize prop, so they automatically become flexible
- Panels without initialSizes share available space equally (each gets flex: 1)
- This creates a responsive layout that adapts to container size changes
