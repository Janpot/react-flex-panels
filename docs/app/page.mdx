# React Flex Panels

A React component library for creating flexible panel layouts with ease. Build responsive layouts with intuitive props that map directly to CSS flexbox properties.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-flex-panels
```

## Basic Usage

Import the Panel component and the CSS styles:

```tsx
import { Panel, Resizer } from "react-flex-panels";
import "react-flex-panels/styles";
```

## Panel Properties

The Panel component provides a simple API for flexbox layouts:

- **`group`** - Makes the panel a flex container (enables flexbox layout)
- **`direction`** - Sets flex direction: `'row'` | `'column'` | `'row-reverse'` | `'column-reverse'` (default: `'row'`)
- **`size`** - Sets the flex-basis (fixed size, must be a CSS string like "200px", "20%", etc.)
- **`minSize`** - Sets the minimum size (respects parent's flex direction: min-width for rows, min-height for columns)
- **`maxSize`** - Sets the maximum size (respects parent's flex direction: max-width for rows, max-height for columns)

### Automatic Flex Behavior

Panels automatically handle flex-grow and flex-shrink based on whether they have a `size` prop:

- **Panels with `size`** - Have fixed dimensions (flex-grow: 0, flex-shrink: 0)
- **Panels without `size`** - Automatically grow and shrink to fill available space (flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1)

## Resizer Properties

- **`className`** - Additional CSS classes
- **`style`** - Inline styles
